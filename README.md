> Highly customizable banner, (not my problem for now.)<br/>
> Implement images as backgrounds (noper)<br/>
> Change the colors of text (somehow didn't add)<br/>
---
>![working_on_it](screenshots/working_on_it.png)<br/>
> A basic frontend website `Make the basic frontend website an advanced one by adding features such as edit settings sign in and out and maybe even games.`<br/>
